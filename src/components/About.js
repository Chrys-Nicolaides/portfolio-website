              I am a multi-disciplinary designer with a background in
              Architecture. I graduated with my Masterâ€™s Degree in Architecture
              in 2016 and have gained 6 years of experience working in the
              field.{" "}

                Today, I am eager to transition into web development and focus
                not only web design but also building impactful and meaningful
                digital experiences for users. I have a passion for problem
                solving and turning complex problems into intuitive and
                straightforward solutions. While I have experience in design, I
                am a pragmatist and appreciate that UX/UI design and development
                are reliant on each other. I strive to grow in both areas in
                hopes of becoming a well rounded front end developer.
